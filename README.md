# Gait-Analysis
- Developed a probabilistic model to determine walking styles to detect possible biomechanical disorders.
- Collected 4500 data samples of walking styles that include regular form of walking apart from walking styles due to neurological disorders that include diplegic walk, hemiplegic walk and parkinsonian walk with the help of sensors.
- Converted and synchronized the data obtained from 4 sensor modules to a JPEG image using Python.
- Trained the last 2 layers of the pre-trained Deep CNN model, inception V3 using images developed for classification into respective walking style which achieved an accuracy of 78\%.
